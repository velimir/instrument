# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Meter attributed writes (`add/3`, `record/3`, `set/3`, and attributed
  observable callbacks) now export under the **registered instrument name**
  with the attributes as data-point attributes, instead of under a
  label-derived name (`<name>_<labels>` for counters/gauges, `<name>_vec_<labels>`
  for histograms). The data was previously unreachable by the documented name.
- The registered instrument no longer appears as a constant-zero, no-attributes
  series when it is only ever written with attributes. The base instrument is
  now registered lazily on its first unlabeled write.

### Changed
- An instrument that is created but never written is no longer exported as a
  zero series; it appears on its first write (matching the OpenTelemetry SDKs).
- In the Prometheus exposition, when one instrument is written with different
  attribute key-sets, the metric family's label columns are the union across
  those key-sets, with empty-string values for absent keys.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed
- OTP 29 compatibility: replaced the deprecated prefix `catch` operator
  with `try ... catch ... end` throughout `src/` and `test/`. Under OTP 29
  the prefix form emits a deprecation warning, which `warnings_as_errors`
  turned into a build failure.

### Changed
- CI now builds and runs the test suite on OTP 29, alongside OTP 27 and 28.
- Bumped the `meck` test dependency to 1.2.0. Older versions use the
  deprecated prefix `catch` in their own source and fail to compile on
  OTP 29.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- A registry restart no longer silently drops previously-created OTel
  instruments. `instrument_registry:init/1` recreated the ETS tables empty
  and reset the `instrument_metrics` index to `[]`, but left the per-name
  `persistent_term` entries behind. The surviving `{otel_instrument, Name}`
  made `instrument_meter:get_instrument/1` return a stale record, so
  `create_counter` / `create_up_down_counter` / `create_histogram`
  short-circuited and never re-registered the underlying metric, while the
  index stayed empty — the metric vanished from `collect_all/0` and the
  Prometheus export even though `add`/`record` kept succeeding. `init/1` now
  erases the stale `otel_instrument`, `otel_instruments`, `instrument_metric`,
  `instrument_label`, and `instrument_label_overflow` entries, so
  `get_instrument/1` returns `undefined` after a restart and the metric
  self-heals on the next `create_*`. `unregister_all` clears the same set
  (it previously missed `otel_instrument` / `otel_instruments`).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- `observable_counter` instruments now render as Prometheus `counter`
  with the `_total` suffix instead of `gauge`, in both unlabeled and
  labeled exposition. Previously `create_observable_instrument/3`
  hardcoded gauge-shaped underlying storage and the labeled write path
  tagged the vec as `gauge`, so tooling that relies on `# TYPE … counter`
  to decide rate-ability (Grafana, `rate()`, alerting rules) saw the
  wrong type.
- `instrument_meter:add/3` on a labeled `up_down_counter` no longer
  crashes on negative deltas. The labeled write path previously hardcoded
  counter-shaped vec storage and hit `instrument_counter:inc_counter/2`'s
  `Val >= 0` guard. It now routes through gauge-shaped vec storage with
  a sign split, so `add(Instrument, -1, #{label => ...})` decrements the
  per-label-set value.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- Histogram bucket counts and the running sum are now backed by a single
  OTP `atomics' array per histogram (slot 1 = IEEE-754 bits of the sum
  via CAS retry, slots 2..N+2 = signed int64 bucket counts via
  `atomics:add/3'). Drops the per-bucket NIF resources and makes
  `get_histogram' / `collect' ~1.5x faster; `observe_histogram' is
  unchanged. Counters, gauges, and up-down counters remain on the NIF
  path.
- Histogram `count' and per-bucket `count' fields in the collected map
  are now integers, matching the `instrument_metrics_exporter' spec
  which already declared them as `integer()'. Callers that compared
  these fields with `=:=' against `float()' values must update their
  expectations.

### Added
- `instrument_atomics' module: thin wrapper over `atomics' providing
  signed-integer slots and IEEE-754 double slots via bit-cast with a
  CAS retry loop.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-03

First stable release. Hardens the runtime under contention and at high
cardinality, brings the OTLP path up to spec, fixes deadlock and leak
risks in the export pipeline, and lands a full audit of the documentation
against the actual public API.

### Added
- `OTEL_METRIC_CARDINALITY_LIMIT` (default 2000) caps distinct label sets
  per vector metric. Excess label sets aggregate into one shared series
  tagged `otel.metric.overflow=true`. Dropped count exposed via
  `instrument_registry:cardinality_dropped/1`.
- `instrument_otlp_retry` module: bounded exponential backoff with
  `Retry-After` honoured, classifying transport and HTTP errors per the
  OTel spec. Configurable via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_MAX_RETRIES`,
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY_MS`,
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_RETRY_MAX_DELAY_MS`.
- Span attribute value length limit
  (`OTEL_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT`), per-event and per-link attribute
  count limits (`OTEL_EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_COUNT_LIMIT`,
  `OTEL_LINK_ATTRIBUTE_COUNT_LIMIT`); excess attributes counted in
  `dropped_attributes_count` and emitted as `droppedAttributesCount` in
  OTLP.
- Tracestate caps at 32 entries / 256 bytes; baggage caps at 180
  entries / 8192 bytes per W3C trace-context.
- `instrument_attributes:apply_limits/2,3` and `truncate_value/2`
  helpers.
- Span Export Path section in the design and internals guide explaining
  the full chain from `end_span` to OTLP, with explicit notes that
  `instrument_tracer_nif` serves the flight recorder only.
- Test coverage for 28 documented public APIs that previously had no
  call sites in CT (`instrument_propagation:inject_headers/extract_headers/call_with_context/cast_with_context`,
  `instrument_context:remove_value/spawn_link_with_context`,
  `instrument_config:set_verbose_tracing/is_verbose_tracing/enable_exporter/disable_exporter`,
  `instrument_tracer:record_exception/update_name`,
  `instrument_test:assert_log_trace_context`,
  `instrument_logger:add_trace_context/emit`,
  `instrument_metric:remove_label/clear_labels/set_gauge_to_current_time`,
  exporter callback contracts).

### Changed
- Batch processor `force_flush/0` and the max-batch-size trigger no
  longer block the gen_server loop. An export worker is spawned and
  completion arrives as `{export_done, ...}`; concurrent flush callers
  are batched and replied to via `gen_server:reply/2`. A kill timer
  enforces `export_timeout_millis` without blocking the loop.
- `instrument_exporter` shutdown now casts the hook unregister so the
  reply path stays unblocked.
- `instrument_span_processor:on_start/2` now has a 5 s safety timeout;
  the tracer hot path uses the inline `persistent_term` form.
- OTLP exporters return `{error, retryable, _}` vs `{error, permanent, _}`.
  The batch processor keeps retryable batches for up to
  `max_batch_retries` cycles and drops permanent errors.
- Probability sampler hashes the upper 8 bytes of the trace id, matching
  the Java/Go/Python reference SDKs.
- Status transitions now follow the OTel spec: `unset -> ok|error`,
  `error -> ok` (success overrides), `error -> error` updates the
  description, `ok` is final.
- Batch processor clamps `max_export_batch_size` to `max_queue_size` on
  init with a warning.
- Documentation snippets fixed across `guides/`, `book/`, and `README.md`:
  6 syntax bugs, 8+ calls to non-existent or wrong-arity functions,
  wrong arg shapes for `set_sampler`, `parent_based` config,
  `metric_view` record literal, `exporter_otlp:export`, and stale config
  keys (`schedule_delay_millis`, `export_timeout_millis`).
- Book chapter prose smoothed for readability.

### Fixed
- Histogram exemplar reservoirs are now freed on unregister.
- Registry unregister no longer scans the global `persistent_term`
  index; iterates the metric's own `labels_map` instead.
- Baggage `set/remove/clear` use `set_current/1` so process-dictionary
  context tokens no longer accumulate.
- `instrument_exporter_console:export/2` and
  `instrument_metrics_exporter_console:exporter_export/2` no longer
  crash when configured with `output => {file, Path}`. The `{file, Fd}`
  wrapper used by `shutdown/1` is now unwrapped before
  `io:put_chars/2`.

### Removed
- `instrument_exporter_kafka` documentation section: the module never
  existed in `src/exporters/`.

### Deprecated
- _None._

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- Moved hex package `files` list from `rebar.config` to `instrument.app.src` so `do_build.sh`, `do_cmake.sh`, and `c_src/` build assets are actually shipped in the published tarball (the rebar.config `{hex, [{files, ...}]}` entry was silently ignored for non-standard files)
